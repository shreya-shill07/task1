    <h3 text-align="center"><u>MAIN BUILDING</u></h3>
    <p text-align="left">The Main building that stands tall carrying with
         it the pride of the nation.
    Beautifully written on it is 'Dedicated to the service of the nation' to which it truly stands by. 
    It fills my heart with immense pleasure and at the same 
    time it reminds me my purpose that I must fulfil as a student of IIT Kharagpur.
    I would never forget the feeling when I first stepped into this place.
     This is what makes it so special.</p>

        <h3 text-align="center" ><u>HELIPAD</u></h3>
        <p text-align="left" >The halipad has a different vibe to itself.
             With the beautiful  landscape of open fields and its fresh green grass,
              it is one of the most soul soothing places of Kgp campus.
            No night out is complete without seeing the awe stricking sunrise at helipad.
             A visit to this place whenever one is feeling down is always recommended.</p>

        <h3 text-align="center" ><u><b>CLOCK TOWER</b></u></h3>
        <p text-align="left">One of the most strickingly beautiful places of the campus is the clock tower.
        This is also a place where people meet , exchange thoughts ,communicate and spend some good sweet time together.
        The countdown during New year's eve occurs here and this gives the 
        year a beautiful grand start.</p><br>
